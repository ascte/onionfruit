## Overview

OnionFruit™ Connect is a free utility that allows users to connect to the Tor Network with minimal effort. Taking a similar form to a VPN program, it's easy to use and gives the user maximum control
Acting as a system proxy, the majority of programs will also be able to connect without much further configuration (including web browsers!).

Changelogs are published on [the DragonFruit Site](https://dragonfruit.network/changelog/onionfruit)

## Features

- Connect to the Tor Network with an on/off switch
- Select the input/output Country (US, GB, ES, etc.)
- Auto-connect at login
- Set custom landing pages (on connect/disconnect)
- Register in Discord RPC
- (Some) Bridge Support
- Regular updates with bug fixes, performance improvements and new features

## Getting Started

We've written a wiki article [here](https://github.com/dragonfruitnetwork/OnionFruit/wiki/Getting-Started) if you're unsure how to get started.

Releases can be found under the [releases tab on this repo](https://github.com/dragonfruitnetwork/OnionFruit/releases)

## Bugs, Issues, Feature Requests and Queries

In the event the program fails to operate normally (and crashes) we **should** receive a report (with nothing identifiable inside) allowing us to fix the issue.
If you keep experiencing issues (or want to ask a question/request a feature), feel free to create an issue and we'll get back to you ASAP.

> If you want to turn off bug reporting, you can do so in the settings page

## Licenses

OnionFruit™ Connect is a closed-source program. One of the reasons for this is because we use proprietary assembles to create our UI (mainly Telerik).
We can't share these so there is not much point in disclosing the majority of the source with the aim to allow people to improve the app (we also don't want similar versions of the app flooding the market).
Because of this, people are free to open issues with feature requests (as stated above) and they can be discussed and planned if there is a high enough demand for them.

You can find the license for the main OnionFruit Program in this repo (we assume that if you are using the app you agree to the terms laid out in the license file)
