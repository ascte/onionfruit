* Boot at startup and auto connect

## Getting Started
If you have no idea where to start, we recommend you take a look at the Getting Started Page in the Wiki. It's also full of extra info that you may find useful if you're ever stuck.

## Licence
Each component of OnionFruit is licenced differently, as we use some open source and some propriatary assembiles, which means we will disclose some source code, but not all of it.
